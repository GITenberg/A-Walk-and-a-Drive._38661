<h2>VISIT TO THE DAIRY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/illus_007b.png" width="100" height="114" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HEN Rosy opened her
eyes the next morning the
sun was shining so brightly
that she was obliged to
shut them again. But a great
many thoughts came into her little
head, and she was in a great hurry
to get up.</div>

<p>Nurse said it was not time yet,
and that she was very sleepy; but
when the little girl had climbed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
her bed, and given her a great many
soft kisses, and told her how much
she wanted to take a walk before
breakfast, the kind nursey first
rubbed her eyes, then opened them,
and then got out of bed.</p>

<p>While she was dressing, Rosy
began to put on her own shoes and
stockings and some of her clothes;
for she had already learnt to do a
great deal for herself.</p>

<p>She peeped out of window to
look for the birds, but for some time
she could not see any.</p>

<p>Rosy thought this very strange,
for she remembered how she used
to hear the dear little birdies sing
when she had been in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in England; but nurse could not
explain the puzzle; so Rosy settled
that it was to be a question for her
papa. Of course he would know;
he always knew everything.</p>

<p>When they were quite ready,
nurse said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, my darling, if you like,
we will go and get your milk for
breakfast; for I know where it is
to be had, and nice, new, good milk
I hope it may be, to make my little
Trotty very fat."</p>

<p>"Is not Rosy fat now?" asked
the little girl, in surprise, and feeling
first her plump cheeks and then her
round arms with her stumpy little
fingers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, pretty well," said nurse
laughing, "but you may be fatter
yet, and I like fat little girls."</p>

<p>They had not to walk far before
they came to the place where the
milk was sold. It was called a
farm; and nurse took Rosy in, and
said she should see the dairy if the
good woman would let her.</p>

<p>Rosy did not know what a dairy
meant; but she supposed that it
was something curious, and tripped
merrily along, wondering what she
should see, till they came to a room
which had a floor made of red tiles,
on which stood at least ten or twelve
large open bowls full of new milk.</p>

<p>Now Rosy happened to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
fond of milk; and as she was just
then quite ready for her breakfast,
she was very pleased to have her
mug filled,&mdash;the mug which she
had brought on purpose, as nurse
told her,&mdash;and then take a good
drink.</p>

<p>"Ah, nurse, how good it is!"
she cried; "but what is all this sticking
to my lips? It is not white like
our milk. See, there is something
on the top of it!" and she held out
her mug to show her.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's cream, good cream.
We did not get milk like this in
Paris," said nurse; "and I'm sure
we don't in London. There's no
water here, is there, madame?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>But madame did not understand
English; so nurse was obliged, by
looking very pleased, to make her
see that she thought her milk very
good.</p>

<p>"But it's very bad of the other
people to put water in my milk,"
said Rosy, frowning. "I shall ask
my papa to scold them when we go
home; and I shall take a great mugful
of this nice milk to show my
grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Well, now say good by prettily
in French, as your papa teaches
you," said nurse, "and then we'll
go home, and I dare say we shall
find some more milk there."</p>

<p>"Adieu, madame," said the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
girl, and off she trotted again, as
ready to go as she had been to
come.</p>

<p>They say "madame" to every one
in France, you know, and not to
rich ladies only.</p>

<p>Now there are beautiful hills all
round the back of Cannes, and a
little way up one of these was the
house where Rosy was going to live.
She did so like running up and
down hills! and there were two or
three little ones between the farm
and this house, which was called a
villa.</p>

<p>When she got on to the top of
one, she cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, there's the sea, I do declare!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and there's a boat on it with a white
sail! Shall we go in a boat some
day?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said nurse,
"you must ask your mamma; but
you don't want to be sick, do you?"</p>

<p>"I won't be sick," cried the little
girl. "Rosy is never sick in a
beau'ful boat like that. I'll ask my
mamma," and she bustled on.</p>

<p>"Stay, stay!" cried nurse, "you're
going too far, my pet; this is the
way; look, who stands up there?"</p>

<p>Rosy looked up, and there was
the villa with its green blinds high
up over her head; and some one
stood outside the door calling her by
name.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>O, what a number of steps there
were for those little legs to climb
before she reached her papa!</p>

<p>They went up by the side of a
garden, which was itself like a lot
of wide steps, and on each step
there was a row of vines, not trained
against a wall as we train our
vines in England, but growing on
the ground like bean plants.</p>

<p>Rosy saw lots of such nice grapes
that her little mouth quite watered,
and she would have liked to have
stopped to pick some; but then she
knew that would be stealing, because
they were not hers. And I
hope that Rosy would not have
stolen even if nurse had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
following her, or her papa watching
her.</p>

<p>She got the grapes, too, without
picking them; for when she had
climbed up to the very top, there
was papa waiting for her with a
beautiful bunch in his hand. And
he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come in, Rosy; mamma wants
her breakfast very badly. See,
mamma, what a pair of roses your
little girl has been getting already!"</p>

<p>Rosy knew very well what that
meant, for she rubbed her cheeks
with her little fat hands, and then
tumbled her merry little head about
her mamma's lap to "roll the roses
off," as she said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>But that little head was too full
of thoughts to stay there long.</p>

<p>There was so much to tell and to
talk about, and that dairy took a
long time to describe. Then when
papa asked if she had seen the dear
cows that gave the milk, she thought
that that would be a capital little
jaunt for to-morrow, and clapped
her hands with glee.</p>

<p>"So you are going to find some
new pets, Rosy," he said, "to do
instead of Mr. Tommy and the
kittens?"</p>

<p>"Ah, papa, but there are no
dickies here&mdash;I mean, hardly any,"
she answered. "We looked so for
the birdies all, all the time; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
only two came, and went away
again directly."</p>

<p>"We must go out and see the
reason of that," said papa, smiling,&mdash;"you
and I, Rosy, directly after
breakfast. We must go and tell
the dear birds that Rosy has come."</p>

<h2>A WALK AND A DRIVE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/illus_019.png" width="118" height="140" alt="R" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OSY made such haste to
finish her bread and milk,
that she was ready to go
out before any one else had
done breakfast. But her papa was
not long before he was ready too,
and she was soon tripping along by
his side.</div>

<p>They went only a little way up
the road, and then they came to a
field, on one side of which were
some high bushes. Rosy knew
where to look for birds, and peeped
very anxiously amidst the boughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
till she saw something hopping.
Then she pulled her papa's hand,
and let him know that she wanted
him to stoop down and look too.</p>

<p>He looked, and then whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Rosy. There is a pretty
little robin; let us go round the
other side and see if we can make
him come out with these crumbs
which I have brought with me."</p>

<p>So they went softly to the gate,
and were just going in, when papa
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop, Rosy; look what that man
has got in his hand."</p>

<p>Then she looked, and saw a man
with a very long gun and two dogs.</p>

<p>"What is he going to do, papa?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
asked the little girl, drawing back;
"will he shoot us if we go in?"</p>

<p>"O, no, Rosy; don't be afraid.
It is the robin that he wants to shoot
and not us. So now you see how
it is that the dicky-birds don't sing
much at Cannes. It is because they
shoot so many of them."</p>

<p>Poor little Rosy! She loved so
much to watch the little birds and
hear them sing! And when she
thought of this dear robin being
shot quite dead, and that perhaps
there was a nest somewhere with
little ones who would have no mamma,
she began to cry, and to call the
man "a cruel fellow."</p>

<p>She was not much comforted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
being told that such little birds
were eaten there; so that if the
man could shoot one, he would get
some money for it which might buy
bread for his little ones. But she
was rather glad to hear that the
little robins must be able by that
time of year to take care of themselves,
and had left the nest some
time; and much more pleased,
when, soon after, she saw the dear
robin fly right away, so that the
man with the gun was not likely to
shoot that one at any rate.</p>

<p>Then papa said, "I shouldn't
wonder if mamma would like to go
out this morning. Shall we go
back and see?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/illus_023.jpg" width="362" height="500" alt="Pleased Rosy" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Rosy was very much pleased when soon after
she saw the robin fly right away.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosy thought that would be very
nice; and then her papa lifted up
his little girl, and showed her all
the beautiful hills that were behind
them. There were some that had
peaked tops, and some rather roundish;
and just in one place she could
see some hills a very long way off,
that seemed to climb right up into
the sky and were all white on the
top. He told her that those hills
were called mountains, because they
were so very high,&mdash;a great deal
too high for Rosy to walk up, and
that the white stuff which she saw
was snow.</p>

<p>"We don't have snow when it is
warm in England, Rosy, do we?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
said papa, "nor yet here, but up
there, you see, it is so cold that the
snow never melts. Those are called
'the snow Alps.'"</p>

<p>Rosy had nearly forgotten the
poor birds now, because there were
so many other things to think about.
She saw some poppies a little way
off, and then some blue flowers;
and they were so pretty that she
was quite obliged to stop a good
many times to pick some for dear
mamma. The wind was very high
too, and it blew little Rosy's hat
right off, so that papa and she had
both to run after it.</p>

<p>Mamma was ready for a walk
when they got in, but she staid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
put Rosy's flowers in water; and
they looked very gay and pretty.
Nurse and every one admired them;
and Rosy said that she was not a
bit tired, and was quite sure that
she could go for another long, long
walk.</p>

<p>But papa said that though Rosy
might be a little horse, her mamma
was not, and that it was a long way
to the town and to the shops where
she wanted to go; so he would go
and get a carriage for them.</p>

<p>Now, though Rosy certainly was
very tired of trains, she found a
basket pony-carriage a very different
thing, and enjoyed her ride so
much that she was obliged to change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
pretty often from her mamma's lap
to her papa's and back again, just
because she was too happy to sit
still.</p>

<p>The ponies went along merrily
too, as if they were nearly as happy.
They had bells on their necks which
jingled delightfully, and every now
and then they met a carriage, or
even a cart, the horses of which had
bells too. So they had plenty of
music.</p>

<p>They went up one hill and down
another, and the ponies ran so fast,
and turned round the corners of the
roads so quickly, that sometimes
mamma was afraid that the carriage
would be upset, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
would all be "tipped out in a heap."
Rosy thought it would be good fun
if they were. She often rolled
about herself, like a little ball, without
hurting herself; and she thought
that papa and mamma would only
get a little dusty, and that it would
be a nice little job for her to brush
the dust off when she got home.</p>

<p>Just then a number of boys and
girls came along the road to meet
them, and Rosy saw that all the
little ones wore caps, not hats or
bonnets. There was one baby with
large black eyes, whom she would
have liked to kiss and hug. It was
so fat and pretty. But it was dressed
in a way that she had never seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
any baby dressed before, for its feet
and legs were put into a sort of
large bag, so that it could not kick
like other children; and Rosy wondered
how it could laugh so merrily.</p>

<p>When the carriage came near this
little party the man did not hold the
reins of his horses tight as an English
coachman would have done.
He only screamed out to the children,
"Gare! gare!" which Rosy's
papa told her meant "Get out of
the way."</p>

<p>And when they were all past
there came next a great wagon,
piled up with the trunks of trees.
The horses which drew this had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bells; but they had a funny sort of
post sticking up high between their
ears, with lots of things hanging on
to it. They had also three pink
tassels hanging on their faces, one
in front and one on each side.
These tassels shook as they went
along, and looked so pretty that
Rosy thought to herself that if ever
she had a toy horse again she would
ask nurse to make some little tassels
for it just like them. Her papa had
told her, too, that they were to
keep off the flies, which teased the
poor horses very often dreadfully.
And of course Rosy would not like
her horse to be teased.</p>

<p>But the carriage went on while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
she was thinking this; and soon
they saw four old women coming
along the road with large baskets,
full of some green stuff, on their
heads. The little girl did not say
anything as they went by, but she
looked very particularly to see how
they were dressed.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you why she did
this.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, she had
never seen any old women a bit like
them before.</p>

<p>They walked all in a row with
their baskets on their heads, and
with their hands stuck into their
sides, and they talked very fast as
they came along. On their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
they wore very, very large hats,
with small crowns. Rosy had never
seen such hats before, and she
heard her mamma say that she had
never seen them either. Under
these great hats they had nice white
caps, with colored handkerchiefs
over them, which hung down behind.
They had, besides, other
colored handkerchiefs over their
shoulders, and two of them had red
gowns.</p>

<p>Now Rosy had had a present
given her in Paris. It was a piece
of French money, worth ten English
pennies; and with this money she
had bought ten Dutch dolls, which
nursey was going to dress for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
At first she meant them to make an
English school; but now that she
had seen so many funny people she
thought she would like her dolls to
be dressed like the people in Cannes,
because then they would just show
her dear grandmamma how very
nice they looked, and how very
different to English people.</p>

<p>She was very quiet for a little
while, because she was making this
grand plan; but they soon turned
out of the narrow street, and all at
once she saw the sea again.</p>

<p>They had come now to what was
called the "port," and there were
all the great ships which had come
home lately, and were waiting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
go out again,&mdash;one, two, three,
four, five, six, all in a row, quite
quiet, and "taking their naps," as
Rosy's papa said, "after all their
hard work."</p>

<p>He lifted Rosy out first, and said
that they would go and look at
them, while mamma went into the
shops.</p>

<p>Rosy was not quite sure whether
she was pleased at that, because
sometimes her mamma bought her
very nice things, such as toys, or
sugar-plums, or cakes, when she
took her out shopping. But they
soon found plenty to look at, and
some funny men with blue coats and
cocked hats amused the little girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
very much. Her papa wondered
why she looked at them so often;
but then he did not know Rosy's
grand scheme, and how she was
thinking of asking nurse to dress
one doll just like them. She kept
this little plan quite a secret till she
got back to her nurse.</p>

<p>It was half the fun to have a
secret.</p>

<h2>ROSY'S VISIT TO THE COWS.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/illus_037.png" width="118" height="140" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE dear, good nursey did
not forget about the cows
next morning, for when
Rosy opened her little
blue peepers there she was half
dressed.</div>

<p>Rosy jumped up in a minute,
crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The cows! the cows! Shall we
go and see them?"</p>

<p>"If you will make great haste,"
said the nurse; "but it is getting
late."</p>

<p>Rosy never got dressed more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
quickly. She did not much like
even to wait for her morning splash;
and while her curls were being
combed, she kept saying, "Won't
it do, nurse?" and then rather
hindering by holding up her little
face for a kiss.</p>

<p>As soon as she was quite ready
she bustled off, and got down stairs
first. Whom should she see there
but papa himself, with his hat
on?</p>

<p>He said that he would take her
to see the cows, and even carry her
a little way if she got tired.</p>

<p>How very kind that was! But
would such a great girl as Rosy get
tired?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>O, dear, no; at least, so she said,
for Rosy did not like to be thought
a baby now, though somehow or
other it did sometimes happens that
after a long walk her feet would
ache a little bit, and then papa's
shoulder made a very comfortable
seat.</p>

<p>She was half afraid now that
nursey might be sorry not to see
the cows, and ran back to whisper
that if she liked she might
dress one of the dollies instead.
That was meant for a treat, you
know; and nursey laughed, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps, we shall see;" and
gave her another kiss.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Rosy showed her papa
where the farm was; and when
they came near, they saw the
farmer's wife standing at the door,
as if she expected her little visitor.</p>

<p>Rosy did not forget to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bon jour, madame," which
means "Good morning" in English,
you know.</p>

<p>Papa asked in French if they
could see the cows, and the good
woman was kind enough to take
them round to the water where they
were drinking.</p>

<p>There was a black one, and a
black and white one, and a red one,
and another with red spots. We
cannot find room for them all in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
picture; but you will see the one
which was drinking.</p>

<p>Rosy admired them very much,
and wanted to go as near as she
could that she might see them well;
for although they were so very big
and had such long legs, she was
not a bit afraid of them. She
never was afraid of anything when
her papa was by, because he was so
very strong&mdash;stronger than all
the world she thought.</p>

<p>"Who made the cows, Rosy?"
asked her papa, when she had
looked at them a little while.</p>

<p>"God," said Rosy, softly; "God
made everything, didn't he, papa?
Why did he make the cows?" she
asked, after thinking a minute.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"To give us good milk, such as
you had yesterday, Rosy, and to
make you and other little girls and
boys fat and strong. Was not that
very good of God!"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," said Rosy, again.</p>

<p>"Then will you remember that,
my little one, when you say, by and
by, 'I thank God for my nice
bread and milk'?"</p>

<p>Rosy said she would, and then
she asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And do the pretty cows give
us coffee, too, papa?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/illus_043.jpg" width="362" height="500" alt="Rosy and Papa" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;And do the pretty cows give us coffee, too, papa.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"No, no, my silly little Rosy;
don't you recollect that we buy that
at the grocer's shop? We must go
some day and ask him to let you see
it ground up to powder. The coffee
comes from a long, long way off.
It grows on a tree in a very hot
country, and looks like little berries
till they put it into a mill and turn
a handle. Then the berries are
ground up to powder, and we put
some boiling water over the powder,
and when it gets cool we drink it.
Haven't you seen mamma pour it
out into the cup and put some sugar
and milk in for herself and papa?"</p>

<p>Rosy remembered now; but she
had not taken much notice before,
because she did not like coffee at
all. She liked her nice milk much
better; and so when she went away
with her papa she called out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good by, dear cowies, and
thank you very much for my nice
milk."</p>

<p>Rosy wanted to walk round the
other side where there was a very
gentle, kind-looking cow, that was
not in the water, because she
thought that she would like to stroke
her; but her papa told her to look
at those two great horns. And he
said that cows did not like little
girls to take liberties with them
unless they knew them, and that
this cow did not know her, and
might think her very saucy, and
poke out her horns to teach her to
keep a proper distance. If she did,
he said he thought Rosy would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like that poke, for it might hurt
her, so he advised her to keep quite
out of the good cow's way.</p>

<p>Then she stood at a little distance
to watch her drinking, and Rosy's
papa said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"See how she enjoys it! Cows
like to come here sometimes, like
little girls; but French cows don't
get out of their houses so often as
English ones."</p>

<p>"Don't they, papa?" said Rosy.
"Then I should think they must
often wish to go to England."</p>

<p>Papa laughed, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps they would wish it if
they knew how their English cousins
enjoy themselves; but I think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
look pretty happy; don't you,
Rosy?"</p>

<p>Rosy said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; but how funnily the
cow drinks! She puts her head
into the water."</p>

<p>"And you think that if she were
a polite cow she would not think
of doing such a vulgar thing, but
would wait till they gave her a glass;
eh, Rosy?"</p>

<p>"She hasn't got any hands, papa,"
cried Rosy, "so she couldn't, I
'spose."</p>

<p>"No," said papa; "so I think
that we must excuse and forgive the
poor thing, until Rosy can teach
her a better plan."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>And Rosy trotted home by his
side, thinking how much she should
like to try drinking after the cow's
fashion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 190px;">

<h2>ROSY'S VISIT TO THE HENS.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/illus_019.png" width="118" height="140" alt="R" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OSY was very hungry
when she got home to
breakfast, for the fresh
morning air had given
her an appetite.</div>

<p>Her mamma took off her hat and
her little jacket, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"So, Rosy, you have brought me
two more roses."</p>

<p>"But my roses don't smell, mamma,"
said Rosy, laughing and patting
her own fat cheeks, as she always
did when mamma said that.
Then she made haste to scramble up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
on to her little chair, and pull her
nice basin of bread and milk close
to her. She looked at her papa
after she had said her little grace,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't forget, papa."</p>

<p>Then she began to eat away as if
she liked it very much; and when
she had eaten a little, her mamma
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, Rosy."</p>

<p>And Rosy turned round and saw
a whole spoonful of egg waiting for
her to eat it. Mamma was holding
it for her; and it looked so yellow
and so delicious!</p>

<p>Rosy opened her mouth, but she
did not take it all in at once. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
was too good for that, and she
thought it better to make it last a
little.</p>

<p>But some of the yellow would
stick on Rosy's lips; so mamma
wiped it off, and then Rosy put her
arms round her neck and kissed her,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"So nice, dear mamma."</p>

<p>Then mamma said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"At the end of the garden, Rosy,
there lives the good hen that gave
us this nice egg, and a great many
other hens, and very fine cocks too,&mdash;the
cocks that you heard crowing
this morning. Shall we go and see
them after breakfast?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, yes, yes!" cried Rosy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
clapping her hands, "that will be
fun. I've almost done mine;" and
the little girl made great haste to
finish her bread and milk; but
mamma said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, but not quite directly. I've
not done my breakfast. If you
have done yours, you had better go
and see what nurse is doing, and
ask her to get ready to come and
hear papa read about Daniel in the
lions' den."</p>

<p>Rosy did not mind waiting for
that, for she was never tired of
hearing that story. I dare say that
some of her young friends know it
too.</p>

<p>Her mamma got ready soon after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and they both went round to a part
of the garden which Rosy had not
seen before.</p>

<p>There they saw that one piece
was railed off from all the rest, and
that a hen-house was inside it.</p>

<p>Rosy's mamma opened a gate in
the railing, and took her little girl
into the enclosure amongst all the
cocks and hens.</p>

<p>The cocks did not seem much to
like this, and they both made a
great crowing, and then marched
off into the farthest corner, with a
lot of hens after them.</p>

<p>Rosy said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, mamma, show them the
nice seed, and then they won't go
away!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>But her mamma answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not yet, Rosy; let us go first
and look at these good ladies that
are walking about inside their house.
We can have a good look at them
before they get away. See, they
can't get out if we stand at the
door."</p>

<p>"Ah, look at these beauties, all
over speckly feathers," cried Rosy,
as she ran forward to catch one.</p>

<p>She put out her little arms to
seize her; but the hen seemed to
think this a great liberty from so
small a child, and instead of running
away, she turned and opened
her beak in a very angry manner.</p>

<p>"Take care, Rosy," said her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
mamma, as the little girl drew back
half frightened. "This hen seems
rather a fierce lady. I will give
her some seed to persuade her to be
quiet. Perhaps she has got something
there that she does not choose
us to see. I wonder what it can
be."</p>

<p>Rosy took one more peep, and
then called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, mamma, mamma, some little
chickens, I do declare! If you
stoop down you can see them running
about behind her,&mdash;such dear,
pretty, soft little creatures! Do
get me one to play with."</p>

<p>"Little chickens!" said mamma;
"why, they must have come out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
their shells very late in the year if
they are little ones still, and I am
afraid their mother won't let me
touch them."</p>

<p>"Do chickens come out of shells?"
said Rosy, making very large eyes,
and looking quite puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rosy, out of just such
shells as our eggs had this morning;
and if in the summer we had given
this good hen five or six of her own
eggs in this little house of hers, she
would have sat upon them, and
spread her wings over them to keep
them warm; and there she would
have staid so patiently all day long,
and day after day, until the dear
little chickens were ready to come
too."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"And wouldn't the hen get tired?"
said Rosy. "I shouldn't like to stay
still so long."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you would,"
said her mamma, chucking her little
girl under the chin; "but then, you
see, you are like the little chickens,
and not like the mamma hen. I
think you will find that she has not
got tired even yet, for if you peep
down again you will see that she is
keeping two of the little chickens
warm under her even now. Little
chickens are like little babies, and
they very soon get cold, so they like
keeping very close to their mammas."</p>

<p>"Are the little chickens naughty
sometimes?" asked Rosy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/illus_059.jpg" width="374" height="500" alt="Rosy and chickens" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;If you stoop down you will see that she is keeping two
of the little chickens warm under her.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, I don't know, Rosy; but I
know that I have often thought it
very pretty to see how they will all
run to their mother when the great
hen clucks for them."</p>

<p>"O, mamma, I should <i>so</i> like to
hear her cluck," cried Rosy, clapping
her hands.</p>

<p>"Well, Rosy, you go a little way
off, and keep quite quiet; and then
I will see if I can tempt the good
lady out of her nest with some of
this nice seed."</p>

<p>So Rosy ran away, and her mamma
stepped back a few paces and
threw down some of the seed.
The hen saw it directly, and looked
for an instant as if she would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
some very much; and she did not
wait long, but soon stepped out of
her house, and began picking up the
seed.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a cat came
creeping along the outside of the
paling, and watching to see if she
could pounce on one of the little
chickens. The hen saw the cat, and
began to stretch out her neck very
fiercely, as if she meant to fly at its
eyes, and then began to cluck for
her little ones, which all came running
to her as fast as their legs
would carry them.</p>

<p>Rosy's little eyes sparkled with
pleasure, and she went up and put
her hand into her mamma's, and
said softly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wasn't it nice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Rosy," said her mamma,
"and I hope that my little chicken
will always run to my side as quickly
as these did to their mother. You
see she knew that they were in
danger when they didn't themselves;
and so do I sometimes when my
Rosy thinks she is quite safe."</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
